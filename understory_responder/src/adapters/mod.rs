//! Adapters to integrate with other Understory crates.
//!
//! This module provides integration helpers for spatial data structures and UI frameworks.
//! Each adapter is gated behind a feature flag to keep the core responder lightweight and `no_std` by default.
//!
//! ## Available Adapters
//!
//! - [`box_tree`] (`box_tree_adapter` feature): Integration with [`understory_box_tree`] for 2D spatial queries
//!   and UI navigation. Converts spatial query results into responder hits and provides filtered
//!   tree traversal for keyboard navigation and focus cycling.
//! - [`hit2d`] (`hit2d_adapter` feature): Helpers for feeding precise 2D geometry hits into the responder.

#[cfg(feature = "box_tree_adapter")]
pub mod box_tree;

#[cfg(feature = "hit2d_adapter")]
pub mod hit2d;
